# Binary System

simulating a binary system

## AIM

STAGE 1: Simulate the trajectory of a binary system

- INPUT: m1, m2, orbital_period
- p1(r,theta,pi), p2(r, theta, phi)
- function to update the positions
- How long to run the coordinates
- We need to store the coordinates

STAGE 2: Spectroscopic binary Use change in redshift to simulate the orbit.
STAGE 3: Eclipsing binary orbit from light curve
